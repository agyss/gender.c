# gender.c
This is a fork from gender.c, written by JÃ¶rg MICHAEL (astro.joerg_googlemail.com) in the years 2007 and 2008. The <a href="readme_g.txt">original README</a> is linked here.

## Purpose
The original purpose of the program was to find the right addressation for a person based on their first names. The provided data and structure are really valuable and may provide solid ground for further firstname-based projects.

## Todos:
* Compilation not tested, program is provided AS IS from (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2020*/ftp://ftp.heise.de/pub/ct/listings/0717-182.zip">webarchiv</a>)
* Data was carefully collected back in 2008 (see original README), but should be updated
* Not all countries from the world are covered
* Currently no support for more modern (Python, Node, ...) environments
* <a href="nam_dict.txt">Data</a> should be converted in more modern format (JSON?)
